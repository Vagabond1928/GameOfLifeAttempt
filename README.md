# GameOfLifeAttempt
This is my attempt at making the game of life program. It is made using the P5 JS library to assist in making the animations and shapes etc. Please look at the read me for more information :D

This is for the positon at BBC for a placement. I have added comments and such on the code to explain how it works. I have also added some images showing it run with the different known behaiviors like Blinkers and Blocks etc. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life Going to Examples of Patterns for a better explaination)

I used Atom editor and a Python web server to host the code.

It is built using P5, more information on that is available here. (https://p5js.org) It is also possible to have it run on the web editor
